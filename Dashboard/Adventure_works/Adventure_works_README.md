**Adventure_Works - PowerBI Dashboard**

**Objective:**
To create an organized dashborad to present the performace of the business on the market and also the key areas the business should
focus on for rapid growth.

**Key Insights:** 
1.The revenue has been steadily rising, a sign that the company is generating more money than it did in prior months.When compared to
other products, accessories are the most frequently ordered. However,among other products, the bikes bring in the most revenue. 
2.In terms of geographic analysis, the United States leads the world in order placement, which results in more income from that area. 
3.Leaving the Pacific region in third place, the European region places more orders than the pacific region. Targeting the European and Pacific markets with
marketing campaigns, promotions, incentives, and first-rate customer service will increase sales and orders. 
4.A target of 10% of overall profit, revenue, and returns was set, and while the company did not meet this goal, it was close to it.It doesn't necessarily imply that the
company is doing worse. Both the revenue and the return rate are maintained as they grow. Numerous factors, including social trends,
seasonal market fluctuations, and a lack of marketing and branding,contribute to the target's failure.
5.The fact that the number of consumers has grown over time may indicate that the company's reputation is strong, that customer service is improving, and that it is becoming
more competitive in the market.The majority of orders are placed by middle-level and lower-level income earners, indicating that the company
pays attention to all demographics and offering goods and services that meet the needs of a broad spectrum of customers. 
6.Overall, Adventure Works is a profitable business with low returns, but order growth is slightly below expectations. Expansion in Europe/Pacific regions and
customer loyalty strategies can drive future growth.
